# Build a class EmailParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').

#First we need to define a class EmailParser.

class EmailParser
#Then our instances need to be initialized with an email string.
#I want the instance of EmailParser to have a property "list" where the array will be stored.
  attr_accessor :list

#Using a method parse, we want to separate them into unique emails.
#How do we do this?



#I want my end result to be an array of emails.
  :list
